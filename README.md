# Model Performance Summary & Recommendation

## Overview
After evaluating multiple classification models on the available dataset, the following observations were made:

- **Overall Accuracy**: Approximately 77%.
- **Minority Class Performance (Class 1)**: Precision, recall, and F1-score are near 0, indicating poor identification of Class 1 instances.
- **Class Imbalance**: Only 23% of the test set belongs to Class 1, contributing to the models' bias toward the majority class (Class 0).

## Root Cause
The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance, with Class 0 outnumbering Class 1. This imbalance causes machine learning models to favor the majority class, resulting in misleading accuracy metrics and poor performance on the minority class.

## Recommendations
To enhance model performance, particularly for detecting minority class instances, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Collect More Data**:
   - Prioritize gathering additional examples of Class 1 cases.
   - Ensure the new data is representative and diverse to improve model generalization.

2. **Future Iterations** (Optional):
   - Apply resampling techniques such as SMOTE or oversampling to balance the dataset.
   - Use models with class weighting to address imbalance during training.
   - Evaluate models using F1-score or recall instead of accuracy to focus on balanced performance metrics.

## Next Steps
Addressing the class imbalance is critical before proceeding with model deployment or deriving insights from predictions. Implementing these recommendations will help ensure fairness and reliability in the model's results.
